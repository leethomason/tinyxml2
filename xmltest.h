/** @page Example-3 Get information out of XML
    @dontinclude ./xmltest.cpp
    In this example, we navigate a simple XML
    file, and read some interesting text. Note
    that this is examlpe doesn't use error
    checking; working code should check for null
    pointers when walking an XML tree, or use
    XMLHandle.

    (The XML is an excerpt from "dream.xml").

    @skip example_3
    @until </PLAY>";

    The structure of the XML file is:

    <ul>
        <li>(declaration)</li>
        <li>(dtd stuff)</li>
        <li>Element "PLAY"</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Element "TITLE"</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Text "A Midsummer Night's Dream"</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    For this example, we want to print out the
    title of the play. The text of the title (what
    we want) is child of the "TITLE" element which
    is a child of the "PLAY" element.

    We want to skip the declaration and dtd, so the
    method FirstChildElement() is a good choice. The
    FirstChildElement() of the Document is the "PLAY"
    Element, the FirstChildElement() of the "PLAY" Element
    is the "TITLE" Element.

    @until ( "TITLE" );

    We can then use the convenience function GetText()
    to get the title of the play.

    @until title );

    Text is just another Node in the XML DOM. And in
    fact you should be a little cautious with it, as
    text nodes can contain elements.

    @verbatim
    Consider: A Midsummer Night's <b>Dream</b>
    @endverbatim

    It is more correct to actually query the Text Node
    if in doubt:

    @until title );

    Noting that here we use FirstChild() since we are
    looking for XMLText, not an element, and ToText()
    is a cast from a Node to a XMLText.

/** @page Example-4 Read attributes and text information.
    @dontinclude ./xmltest.cpp

    There are fundamentally 2 ways of writing a key-value
    pair into an XML file. (Something that's always annoyed
    me about XML.) Either by using attributes, or by writing
    the key name into an element and the value into
    the text node wrapped by the element. Both approaches
    are illustrated in this example, which shows two ways
    to encode the value "2" into the key "v":

    @skip example_4
    @until "</information>";

    TinyXML-2 has accessors for both approaches.

    When using an attribute, you navigate to the XMLElement
    with that attribute and use the QueryIntAttribute()
    group of methods. (Also QueryFloatAttribute(), etc.)

    @skip XMLElement* attributeApproachElement
    @until &v0 );

    When using the text approach, you need to navigate
    down one more step to the XMLElement that contains
    the text. Note the extra FirstChildElement( "v" )
    in the code below. The value of the text can then
    be safely queried with the QueryIntText() group
    of methods. (Also QueryFloatText(), etc.)

    @skip XMLElement* textApproachElement
    @until &v1 );
